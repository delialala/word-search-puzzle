WORD SPY  is a word search puzzle game, in which the player is tasked to find the words from a list inside a matrix. Although the gameplay model is a classic one, WORD SPY provides the player the ability to customize their experience by providing them the option of changing the theme of the game, the matrix size, the domain the words belong to, and the time they have to find the words. Furthermore, the game’s aesthetic is inspired by 90’s games, specifically the kind of games one can find on the original Game Boy.

On the title screen, the player has the choice between two buttons: START and THEMES.

•	The THEMES button opens an in-game pop up window in which the player can choose a preferred theme

•	The START button also opens an in-game pop up window, this time prompting the player to choose their preferred way of playing the game. Finally, the player can choose to start the game.

The main game screen contains:

•	The matrix of letters in which the player has to find the words inside the list

•	The list itself, which updates when a word is found

•	The timer showing how much time the player has left

•	A button that takes the player back to the main screen

•	A hint button, that opens a window containing the placement of the words inside the matrix. We hope each player will use this button to their own discretion!
